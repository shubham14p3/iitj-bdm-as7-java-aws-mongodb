customer collection.

collection.
5. Write the method query2Nest() that returns order date for a given order id using the
custorders collection.
6. Write the method query3() that returns the total number of orders using the orders
collection.
7. Write the method query3Nest() that returns the total number of orders using the
custorders collection.
8. Write the method query4() that returns the top 5 customers based on total order amount
